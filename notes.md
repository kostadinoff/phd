- For example, lymphomatoid granulomatosis (less than 50 cases a year in the USA) is often misdiagnosed as T-cell lymphoma and is consequently mistreated. It is typical for patients to go for over a year without a proper diagnosis.
- The US Congress Orphan Drug Act 1983 defines ‘rare’ as “under 200 000 cases in the USA, or more than 200 000 cases but no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing a new drug for this condition will be recovered from its sales”
- Oncologists obviously have to devote most of their time to managing patients with common cancers and will understandably concentrate on publishing on these diseases. Physicians may only see a very rare

-cancer once or twice in their career, yet the importance of discussing and disseminating information on these cases should not be underestimated.

@Tan2003

For studies to have sufficient statistical power ( ≥ 80%) to detect treatment effects of this magnitude, several hundreds of deaths (typically 200 to 500) need to be observed. This implies trial sizes that are unrealistically large for rare cancers.

@Gatta2006

- These problems can be addressed by use of population-based cancer-registries data to avoid selection bias and by compilation of large international databases on rare cancer
- We defined rare cancers as those with an annual crude incidence rate of less than 2 per 100 000 for both sexes combined.
- We have shown that survival for rare cancers decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, as for most common cancers.
- With regard to variations in survival across geographic groups, differences in access to diagnostic facilities and specialised treatments may be important, since these vary markedly across Europe. However, in much of northern and western Europe, multidisciplinary specialist care is well developed. In some countries of eastern Europe, cancer services are commonly provided by oncologists and surgeons who are not specialised in the treatment of particular cancer sites; moreover, few of these eastern European countries participate in clinical trials
- Geographic variation in survival for these cancers might therefore reflect differences in the use of effective treatment protocols. By contrast, little or no treatment
  advances have been achieved from 1983 to 1994 for squamous-cell carcinoma of bladder, adrenal-cortex carcinoma, and mesothelioma. For these cancers, geographic variation in outcome might reflect differences in diagnosis (eg, accuracy of histological diagnosis for mesothelioma) or in quality of follow-up by cancer registries (eg, loss of information on death).

-Rare cancers pose particular problems for health-care organisation, clinical decision-making, and translational research. Development and availability of new treatments also depends on designation of orphan drugs. Current definitions of rare cancers are unsatisfactory because of their basis on prevalence (see http://www.rarediseases.org), which is frequently unknown. Addressing these issues needs Europeanwide networks to generate epidemiological data, coordinate adequately powered multicentre clinical studies, and disseminate information on best practice and treatment advances. The European Commission has recognised the importance of rare diseases, and is encouraging the creation of a European network of excellence

@greenlee_occurrence_2010

- We adopted the definition of “rare” from a recent NCI-sponsored cancer epidemiology workshop: an incidence of fewer than 150 per million per year (i.e., 15 per 100,000 per year), roughly corresponding in the U.S. to 40,000 new cases per year or fewer
- The resources to identify and describe rare cancer occurrence; understand their causes; and determine the best approaches
  for prevention, detection, and treatment have been suboptimal, leaving patients, clinicians, and policy makers with limited information.
- The association with young adults is compatible with the recognition that rare cancers often have a larger genetic component to their etiology than more common cancers

@gatta2010burden

-The list of rare cancers was based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O 3rd edition) and it was hierarchically structured in 2 layers based on various combinations of ICD-O morphology and topography codes: layer (1) families
of tumors (relevant for the health care organisation) and layer (2) tumors clinically meaningful (relevant for clinical decision making and research).

-However, prevalence has shortcomings as a measure for rarity for tumors, although we acknowledge its appropriateness for non-neoplastic diseases. Many of these are chronic conditions, so prevalence, which reflects the total number of cases at any given time in a population truly renders the burden that a disease poses at a population level. On the contrary, tumors are subacute diseases in which everything tends to happen once. In the natural history of a tumor, there will be one potentially eradicating surgery, one local radiation therapy, one first chemotherapy and each of these will take place in a definite time intervals. Thus, the total amount of resources
that tumors mobilize are proportional to the yearly rate of new diagnoses (incidence) and not to the total amount of persons with previous cancer diagnosis (prevalence)

- the incidence of tumors tends to change in a more predictable manner than prevalence and it is more closely connected to the cause of the diseases;
- the incidence is a direct measure of the burden imposed by the need for the first line cancer treatment;
- the number of patients amenable to enter a clinical study is reflected by cancer
  incidence.

Clinical decision-making is more problematic in the case of a rare tumor because clinical studies on that tumor are more difficult to carry out so the quality of available evidence tends to be limited. Under this perspective, a liposarcoma or a bronchioloalveolar lung carcinoma are similar because the feasibility of clinical studies on both conditions is equally affected by their low frequency.
Also the organization of health care is more problematic in the case of a rare tumor because the direct clinical expertise of any oncologist will be limited in comparison to the one that they have on common cancers so some kind of centralized
patient referral needs to be implemented (towards centres or networks of excellence). Under this perspective a liposarcoma and a bronchioloalveolar lung carcinoma are not alike because the former belongs to a family of tumors which are rare as such, while the latter is a lung tumor i.e. it belongs to a family of common tumors. Any community oncologist deals everyday with lung tumors and will be aware of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma while this will not be the case for any sarcoma. In fact, centralized patient referral is generally recommended for sarcomas but not for lung tumors. A bronchioloalveolar carcinoma will be rare under the clinical decision-making but not the health care organization perspective while any
sarcoma will be rare under both perspectives.

- The first layer denotes the main families of tumors identified according to a consensus-based clinical perspective. This partitioning should be mainly useful for patient referral purposes i.e. it is relevant under the health care
  organization perspective.

-The second layer denotes tumors relevant from the clinical, mainly the therapeutic, decision-making perspective (ICD-O coded entities have been grouped on the basis of their similar clinical management).

- The first reason is to follow existing tumor classifications. Any list of rare tumors will always be a subset of a standard list of tumors. International agencies preside over such classifications, constantly updating them, and genetic and molecular profile is more and more relevant to tumor partitioning in such classifications. This list of rare tumors is based on the ICD-O (3rd edition) classification  because this is the worldwide recognized classification of tumors. The second reason is data availability. Cancer registry data, the only data available to calculate population-based incidence and prevalence indicators, refer to cases classified only according to ICD-O. Other, even attractive, classification criteria such as biomarkers or gene expression cannot be used for any quantitative description of cancer burden.
- For instance, an incidence cut point of 1 × 100,000 per year would select a subset of cancer entities affecting about 5.5% of all cancer patients. With a cut point of 10 × 100,000 per year, a wider set of entities would be classified as rare, corresponding to a proportion of 27% of all cancer diagnoses. A well chosen cut point should provide a balance between being too selective (i.e. less that 10% of patients) and too inclusive (more than 30% of patients).
- In conclusion, an incidence cut point of 6 × 100,000 has been identified as the appropriate value to define rare cancers or a group of rare cancers. This means (Fig. 17.1) to consider as rare about 20% of all cancers that arise in the general population. Almost all cancers defined as rare on the basis of the incidence based criterion are rare also according to the European prevalence-based definition of rare disease.
- RARECARE gathered CRs data on patients diagnosed from 1978 up to 2002, with vital status information available up to 31st December 2003 or later. To our knowledge, no similar large-scale analyses of rare tumours have been reported.

# Въведение

Понятието "редки карциноми" е използвано през 1992 , като в своя студия Bruce A. et al. @Chabner1992 коментират различията в клиничния отговор към химиотерапевтични агенти. Авторите отбелязват, че при определени видове тумори с честота на случаите под 1000 на година, провеждането на изследвания от самостоятелни научни организации е затруднено, което предполага необходимостта от междуинституционално сътрудничество с цел изучаването на тази група заболявания.
