- For example, lymphomatoid granulomatosis (less than 50 cases a year in the USA) is often misdiagnosed as T-cell lymphoma and is consequently mistreated. It is typical for patients to go for over a year without a proper diagnosis.

- The US Congress Orphan Drug Act 1983 defines ‘rare’ as “under 200 000 cases in the USA, or more than 200 000 cases but no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing a new drug for this condition will be recovered from its sales”

- Oncologists obviously have to devote most of their time to managing patients with common cancers and will understandably concentrate on publishing on these diseases. Physicians may only see a very rare
  
- cancer once or twice in their career, yet the importance of discussing and disseminating information on these cases should not be underestimated.

@Tan2003

- For studies to have sufficient statistical power ( ≥ 80%) to detect treatment effects of this magnitude, several hundreds of deaths (typically 200 to 500) need to be observed. This implies trial sizes that are unrealistically large for rare cancers.

@Gatta2006

- These problems can be addressed by use of population-based cancer-registries data to avoid selection bias and by compilation of large international databases on rare cancer
  
- We defined rare cancers as those with an annual crude incidence rate of less than 2 per 100 000 for both sexes combined.
  
- We have shown that survival for rare cancers decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, as for most common cancers.
  
- With regard to variations in survival across geographic groups, differences in access to diagnostic facilities and specialised treatments may be important, since these vary markedly across Europe. However, in much of northern and western Europe, multidisciplinary specialist care is well developed. In some countries of eastern Europe, cancer services are commonly provided by oncologists and surgeons who are not specialised in the treatment of particular cancer sites; moreover, few of these eastern European countries participate in clinical trials

- Geographic variation in survival for these cancers might therefore reflect differences in the use of effective treatment protocols. By contrast, little or no treatment advances have been achieved from 1983 to 1994 for squamous-cell carcinoma of bladder, adrenal-cortex carcinoma, and mesothelioma. For these cancers, geographic variation in outcome might reflect differences in diagnosis (eg, accuracy of histological diagnosis for mesothelioma) or in quality of follow-up by cancer registries (eg, loss of information on death).

-Rare cancers pose particular problems for health-care organisation, clinical decision-making, and translational research. Development and availability of new treatments also depends on designation of orphan drugs. Current definitions of rare cancers are unsatisfactory because of their basis on prevalence (see http://www.rarediseases.org), which is frequently unknown. Addressing these issues needs Europeanwide networks to generate epidemiological data, coordinate adequately powered multicentre clinical studies, and disseminate information on best practice and treatment advances. The European Commission has recognised the importance of rare diseases, and is encouraging the creation of a European network of excellence

@greenlee_occurrence_2010

- We adopted the definition of “rare” from a recent NCI-sponsored cancer epidemiology workshop: an incidence of fewer than 150 per million per year (i.e., 15 per 100,000 per year), roughly corresponding in the U.S. to 40,000 new cases per year or fewer
  
- The resources to identify and describe rare cancer occurrence; understand their causes; and determine the best approaches for prevention, detection, and treatment have been suboptimal, leaving patients, clinicians, and policy makers with limited information.

- The association with young adults is compatible with the recognition that rare cancers often have a larger genetic component to their etiology than more common cancers

@gatta2010burden

-The list of rare cancers was based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O 3rd edition) and it was hierarchically structured in 2 layers based on various combinations of ICD-O morphology and topography codes: layer (1) families of tumors (relevant for the health care organisation) and layer (2) tumors clinically meaningful (relevant for clinical decision making and research).

-However, prevalence has shortcomings as a measure for rarity for tumors, although we acknowledge its appropriateness for non-neoplastic diseases. Many of these are chronic conditions, so prevalence, which reflects the total number of cases at any given time in a population truly renders the burden that a disease poses at a population level. On the contrary, tumors are subacute diseases in which everything tends to happen once. In the natural history of a tumor, there will be one potentially eradicating surgery, one local radiation therapy, one first chemotherapy and each of these will take place in a definite time intervals. Thus, the total amount of resources
that tumors mobilize are proportional to the yearly rate of new diagnoses (incidence) and not to the total amount of persons with previous cancer diagnosis (prevalence)

- the incidence of tumors tends to change in a more predictable manner than prevalence and it is more closely connected to the cause of the diseases; the incidence is a direct measure of the burden imposed by the need for the first line cancer treatment; the number of patients amenable to enter a clinical study is reflected by cancer incidence.

- Clinical decision-making is more problematic in the case of a rare tumor because clinical studies on that tumor are more difficult to carry out so the quality of available evidence tends to be limited. Under this perspective, a liposarcoma or a bronchioloalveolar lung carcinoma are similar because the feasibility of clinical studies on both conditions is equally affected by their low frequency. Also the organization of health care is more problematic in the case of a rare tumor because the direct clinical expertise of any oncologist will be limited in comparison to the one that they have on common cancers so some kind of centralized patient referral needs to be implemented (towards centres or networks of excellence). Under this perspective a liposarcoma and a bronchioloalveolar lung carcinoma are not alike because the former belongs to a family of tumors which are rare as such, while the latter is a lung tumor i.e. it belongs to a family of common tumors. Any community oncologist deals everyday with lung tumors and will be aware of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma while this will not be the case for any sarcoma. In fact, centralized patient referral is generally recommended for sarcomas but not for lung tumors. A bronchioloalveolar carcinoma will be rare under the clinical decision-making but not the health care organization perspective while any sarcoma will be rare under both perspectives.

- The first layer denotes the main families of tumors identified according to a consensus-based clinical perspective. This partitioning should be mainly useful for patient referral purposes i.e. it is relevant under the health care organization perspective.

-The second layer denotes tumors relevant from the clinical, mainly the therapeutic, decision-making perspective (ICD-O coded entities have been grouped on the basis of their similar clinical management).

- The first reason is to follow existing tumor classifications. Any list of rare tumors will always be a subset of a standard list of tumors. International agencies preside over such classifications, constantly updating them, and genetic and molecular profile is more and more relevant to tumor partitioning in such classifications. This list of rare tumors is based on the ICD-O (3rd edition) classification  because this is the worldwide recognized classification of tumors. The second reason is data availability. Cancer registry data, the only data available to calculate population-based incidence and prevalence indicators, refer to cases classified only according to ICD-O. Other, even attractive, classification criteria such as biomarkers or gene expression cannot be used for any quantitative description of cancer burden.
  
- For instance, an incidence cut point of 1 × 100,000 per year would select a subset of cancer entities affecting about 5.5% of all cancer patients. With a cut point of 10 × 100,000 per year, a wider set of entities would be classified as rare, corresponding to a proportion of 27% of all cancer diagnoses. A well chosen cut point should provide a balance between being too selective (i.e. less that 10% of patients) and too inclusive (more than 30% of patients).
  
- In conclusion, an incidence cut point of 6 × 100,000 has been identified as the appropriate value to define rare cancers or a group of rare cancers. This means (Fig. 17.1) to consider as rare about 20% of all cancers that arise in the general population. Almost all cancers defined as rare on the basis of the incidence based criterion are rare also according to the European prevalence-based definition of rare disease.
  
- RARECARE gathered CRs data on patients diagnosed from 1978 up to 2002, with vital status information available up to 31st December 2003 or later. To our knowledge, no similar large-scale analyses of rare tumours have been reported.

@gatta_rare_2011

- There is no internationally agreed definition of rare cancers. In Europe rare diseases are often defined as those with aprevalence of <50/100,000 @ref1 . In the US, the Orphan Drug Act defined rare diseases as those affecting <200,000 persons. However, a recent analysis of rare cancers in the US employed the definition of <15 incident cases per 100,000 per year @greenlee_occurrence_2010

- The project Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) collected data on cancers from 89 population-based cancer registries (CRs) in 21 European countries, making it possible to study the epidemiology of these cancers as a
whole in a large and heterogeneous population.

- RARECARE gathered data on cancer patients diagnosed from 1978 to 2002 and archived in population-based CRs, all of which had vital status information available up to at least
31st December 2003. For 11 countries, the CRs covered the entire national population (Austria, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales); the other countries do not have national cancer registration and were represented by regional CRs covering variable proportions of their national populations. The mean population covered, over the period 1995–1999, was about 162,000,000, corresponding to 39% of the population of countries participating in RARECARE and 32% of the European Union (EU27) population. Systematic data checks were performed to detect errors, inconsistencies or unusual combinations of site, morphology, sex and age at diagnosis.7,8 Only a negligible proportion (0.14%) of cases had major errors and had to be excluded.7 RARECARE collected data from 89 CRs; however the present paper considered data from 76 CRs, excluding CRs which did not classify cancers according to the third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O3),9 and also those which collected data on childhood cancers only.

-The bottom tier corresponds to the WHO names of individual cancer entities (http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/ pdfs-online/pat-gen/) and their corresponding ICD-O-39 codes. Bottom tier entities were grouped into categories (middle tier) considered to require similar clinical management and research. Middle tier entities were grouped into general categories (top tier) considered to involve the same clinical expertise and patient referral structure.

-RARECARE defined rare cancers as those with an incidence of <6/100,000/year, corresponding to <30,000 new cases/year in Europe. A total of 186 cancers were rare according to this definition

- About 74% of rare cancers had an annual incidence rate of <0.5/100,000. However, this plethora of cancers accounted for only 70,000 (3%) of the 2.5 million cancers diagnosed each year. Another 17 cancer types, with incidence 0.5–1/100,000, accounted for 49,000 new diagnoses each year in EU27, while the 31 cancer types with incidence >1–6/100,000, accounted for 422,000 new cases/year. Seventeen common cancers accounted for the remaining cases.

- We estimated that 4,300,000 people were alive in the EU27 with a previous diagnosis of a rare cancer, 24% of the total cancer prevalence. Almost all cancers considered rare according to RARECARE are also rare according to the commonly adopted prevalence criterion in Europe1 of <50/100,000. Only squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix and thyroid carcinoma are rare according to the incidence (RARECARE) criterion and ‘common’ according to the prevalence criterion.
  
- Six cancers are common according to the incidence criterion  and rare according to the prevalence criterion. These ar stomach adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas of lung and the group other non-Hodgkin mature B cell lymphomas. The explanation is that these are poor prognosis cancers which hence have low prevalence, even though incidence is relatively high.

-Rare cancers had, on average, worse relative survival tha common cancers. For patients with rare cancers diagnose in 1995–1999, 1, 3 and 5-year relative survival was 68%, 52%
and 47%, respectively; the corresponding figures for patients with common cancers were 80%, 69% and 65%. survival differences between rare and commo cancers were small 1 year after diagnosis but survival for rare
cancers declined more markedly thereafter, consistent wit the idea that treatments for rare cancers are less effectiv than those for common cancers, and suggesting that later stage at diagnosis is not a factor in the poorer survival for rare
cancers.

-For patients 0–39 years – most of whose cancers were rare – survival did not differ between common and rare cancers. The survival disadvantage of having a rare cancer increased from –17% at 40–59 years to –30% at 75–99 years. In the oldest age group, survival for rare cancers was almost half that of common cancers.

-From Fig. 4 it is evident that 5-year survival was similarly high for both rare and common cancers in children and young adults (up to 39 years) but that 5-year survival for rare cancers fell increasingly behind that of common cancers as age of diagnosis increased.

@Hiripi2012

. In Germany, survival for rare cancers ranged from 11.9% (mesothelioma) to 74.7% (male breast
cancer). USA survival estimates were higher than those in Germany for cancer sites, such as the heart, eye, vulva and male breast. Mesothelioma patients in Germany had better survival
than in the United States.

@Munoz2012


- Treatment of metastatic disease has yielded only modest results, and most patients succumb to their disease. To a large extent, these dismal outcomes are probably because cancer consists of hundreds of molecular disease subsets, each requiring its own personalized treatment approach. . Therefore, the standard paradigm of classifying patients by histology alone, and treating large unselected groups of patients with the same treatment is unlikely to dramatically improve outcomes

- There is no single standardized numerical cutoff that encompasses these conditions.

- The US Rare Disease Act of 2002 relies solely on prevalence as “rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small patient populations, typically populations smaller than 200,000 individuals (about one in 1,500 people) in the United States.” @Griggs2009

- In Japan, a rare disease is defined as one that affects fewer than 50,000 patients, or approximately one in 2,500 people

- The European Commission on Public Health defines rare diseases as “life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases that are of such low prevalence that special combined efforts are needed to address them.”4 ESMO defines rare tumours as those with an incidence of fewer than six per 100,000 persons per year

-The United States Orphan Drug Act defines as orphan diseases as conditions “for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug

- prevalence is influenced by survival, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions in patients with an aggressive rare cancer who have a decreased lifespan.

- Based on epidemiological information, alternative definitions of rare cancers have been sought centring on incidence instead of prevalence and rare diseases have been defined in some studies as conditions with an incidence of fewer than six per 100,000 individuals per year in Europe or an incidence of fewer than 15 per 100,000 individuals per year in the USA 

- Thus, an entity that is rare in one group of patients may be common in another, which is particularly true for genetic diseases.

- As an example, several paediatric malignancies are considered rare because in general fewer children develop cancer compared to adults. Some orphan diseases are hereditary; hence, the driving genetic aberrations of such disorders are present throughout the life of a particular patient, even if the associated symptoms are initially silent.

- The definition of targeted therapy is elusive as well. A superficial definition implies that it is a therapy that is used to target a specific molecular aberration or genetic
anomaly. 

-The target or biomarker was discovered first in some cases, such as HER2 in breast cancer, whereas in others the drug was discovered before the target was defined, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). @Sledge2005

-Finally, a given ‘targeted’ therapeutic agent might impact multiple targets (for example, sorafenib, which is a multikinase inhibitor) instead of a single one. Hence, targeted therapy cannot always be defined as having single-target specificity.

- Orphan malignancies demonstrate some of the highest response rates, primarily owing to the identification of a main driver of malignant transformation. In addition, it has been hypothesized that the limited number of underlying pathways leading to these orphan diseases makes them both rare and treatable

- By contrast, slow incremental progress has been demonstrated for treatment of the most common tumours, such as colon, lung and breast cancer, even though the investment in research
for these diseases is many magnitudes greater than for orphan diseases. This dichotomy may be owing to the possibility that multiple molecular pathways drive the development of many common cancers, making them both common and difficult to treat uniformly.

- More recently, it has become increasingly evident that an optimal approach would be to stratify common tumours into molecular subsets, each of which constitutes an orphan disease. An example is ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; seen only in 4% of the lung cancer population), which shows near-universal regression with ALK inhibitor treatment. @Choi2010 

-The application of such molecular pharmacogenetic approaches has tremendous potential for improving the efficacy of novel targeted agents, while diminishing cost and toxicity.

-Some of the most remarkable oncological interventions, resulting in frequent complete or near-complete responses with prolongation of overall survival, have occurred in orphan cancers.

- Indeed, considering their rarity, there is a disproportionately high number
of drugs approved for orphan malignancies compared with drugs for the most-common tumours

-Historically, lung cancer treatment is a good example of the inherent problems associated with an allinclusive therapeutic approach. Treatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, for example, produced responses in 8.9% of all enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC. However, no survival advantage was seen after analysing patients who were not selected by EGFR status, even though some patients had remarkable responses.88 Subsequently, it was demonstrated that gefitinib is active in patients with NSCLC with a mutated EGFR gene

-  Second, it seems increasingly unlikely that common cancers, which
seem to arise as a result of multiple diverse aberrations, will have high response rates to any one therapy

@Bisogno2012 

- In 2008, EXPeRT (European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors) was founded by national groups from Italy, France, United Kingdom, Poland and Germany.

-  The group of pediatric VRTs is extremely heterogeneous involving diff erent organ sites and many histological tumor types. Some are characteristic of the pediatric age, while others occur frequently in adults but rarely in children

-In adult oncology, VRTs are a heterogeneous group of entities that is diffi cult to defi ne. According to the European RARECARE project – an incidence cut-off of less than 6 cases/100 000 population/year should be used to defi ne VRTs. However, this defi nition would include all childhood cancers.

-  Italian TREP project (Tumori Rari in Età Pediatrica [Rare Tumors in Pediatric Age]) introduced a new defi nition of VRTs, using a lower cut-off , i. e., an annual incidence < 2/millions. Moreover, a specifi c tumor entity was only included if it was not enrolled in clinical trials, defi ning it as an orphan disease

- On the other hand, a purely qualitative defi nition of childhood VRTs based on histopathologic classifi cation may pose other problems. In the COG initiative, VRTs were generally classifi ed as other malignant epithelial neoplasms and melanomas according
to the International Classifi cation of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI of the SEER database. As a consequence, several VRTs such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, pancreatoblastoma or sex
cord stromal tumors might be excluded. Therefore, EXPeRT proposes that the group of VRTs should not be defi ned based on epidemiology or pathology alone. Instead, a VRT is mainly characterized by its status as an orphan disease, thus pointing to the
need of the children to have appropriate care.

- any solid malignancy or borderline tumor characterized by an annual incidence < 2/million and/or not already considered in clinical trials

- aims: 1) to develop diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations, 2) to collect clinical dat on diagnostic work-up, treatment and follow-up, 3) to identify experts “dedicated” to each VRT to give advice to treating clinicians, 4) to establish a collaborative network with other specialists (i. e., adult oncologists, surgeons, endocrinologists, dermatologists) involved in the management of these tumors, and 5) to establish prospective clinical, pathological and biological studies.

- The United Kingdom’s Children’s Cancer & Leukaemia Group founded a Rare Tumour Working Group in 1997 . No dedicated registry was developed, but guidelines were developed and selected (and limited) data were collected throughout the UK National Registry of Childhood Tumours.
  
- In 2006, the German Rare Tumor Working Group was founded as a working group of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology . In Germany, there is a long-standing tradition that some VRTs have been registered in prospective studies and registries, respectively. For other patients with VRTs, a consultation service has been established. The registration rate is approximately 50 patients per year from institutions in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 

- In 2002, the Polish Pediatric Solid Tumors Study Group founded the Polish Pediatric Rare Tumors Study Group . After a fi rst retrospective analysis, an advisory platform was activated and opened for physicians, and new patients were collected prospectively. Treatment recommendations were continuously re-evaluated and improved.

- The main objective of EXPeRT is to promote clinical and biological research in pediatric VRT by intensifying collaboration between the founder national groups and international partners. 

- In 2002, COG created the rare tumor committee, which included the infrequent tumor subcommittee

@Lynge2005 

- Some rare cancers are caused by mutations in a single gene, like retinoblastoma of the eye

- Other rare cancers are closely associated with a specific exposure, like adenocarcinoma of the vagina in daughters of mothers using diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy

- rare cancers are known to be caused by occupational exposures, such as pleural mesothelioma in asbestos workers, bone sarcoma in radium dial painters , and liver angiosarcoma in vinyl chloride workers

- Historically, the term ‘‘signal cancer’’ has been used for rare cancers clustering in specific occupations, like nasal adenocarcinoma in furniture-makers in Buckinghamshire, in the United Kingdom (UK), in the early 1960s [@macbeth1965malignant].

- However, little is known about the aetiology of most rare cancers, and these cancers are difficult to study on a national basis due to the small numbers seen. We therefore conducted a case–control study in nine European countries of cancers of the small intestine, male gall bladder and bile ducts, thymus, bone, male breast, eye melanoma, and mycosis fungoides.

# Въведение

Понятието "редки карциноми" е използвано през 1992 , като в своя студия Bruce A. et al. @Chabner1992  коментират различията в клиничния отговор към химиотерапевтични агенти. Авторите отбелязват, че при определени видове тумори с честота на случаите под 1000 на година, провеждането на изследвания от самостоятелни научни организации е затруднено, което предполага необходимостта от междуинституционално сътрудничество с цел изучаването на тази група заболявания.
