We hypothesized that patients with rare cancer benefit from approved anticancer drugs outside their label similar to common cancers.                                         Experimental Design:               In the Drug Rediscovery Protocol ({DRUP}), patients with therapy-refractory metastatic cancers harboring an actionable molecular profile are matched to {FDA}/European Medicines Agency–approved targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Patients are enrolled in parallel cohorts based on the histologic tumor type, molecular profile and study drug. Primary endpoint is clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, stable disease ≥ 16 weeks).                                         Results:               Of 1,145 submitted cases, 500 patients, including 164 patients with rare cancers, started one of the 25 available drugs and were evaluable for treatment outcome. The overall clinical benefit rate was 33\% in both the rare cancer and nonrare cancer subgroup. Inactivating alterations of {CDKN}2A and activating {BRAF} aberrations were overrepresented in patients with rare cancer compared with nonrare cancers, resulting in more matches to {CDK}4/6 inhibitors (14\% vs. 4\%; P ≤ 0.001) or {BRAF} inhibitors (9\% vs. 1\%; P ≤ 0.001). Patients with rare cancer treated with small-molecule inhibitors targeting {BRAF} experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (75\%) than the nonrare cancer subgroup.                                         Conclusions:               Comprehensive molecular testing in patients with rare cancers may identify treatment opportunities and clinical benefit similar to patients with common cancers. Our findings highlight the importance of access to broad molecular diagnostics to ensure equal treatment opportunities for all patients with cancer.","","","",""

We evaluated the descriptive epidemiology of rare cancers using a large, representative, population-based dataset from cancer registries in the United States.                                         Methods.               We analyzed more than 9 million adult cancers diagnosed from 1995 to 2004 in 39 states and two metropolitan areas using the Cancer in North America ({CINA}) dataset, which covers approximately 80\% of the U.S. population. We applied an accepted cancer classification scheme and a published definition of rare (i.e., fewer than 15 cases per 100,000 per year). We calculated age-adjusted incidence rates and rare/non-rare incidence rate ratios using {SEER}*Stat software, with analyses stratified by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and histology.                                         Results.               Sixty of 71 cancer types were rare, accounting for 25\% of all adult tumors. Rare cancers occurred with greater relative frequency among those who were younger, nonwhite, and of Hispanic ethnicity than among their older, white, or non-Hispanic counterparts.                                         Conclusions.               Collectively, rare tumors account for a sizable portion of adult cancers, and disproportionately affect some demographic groups. Maturing population-based cancer surveillance data can be an important source for research on rare cancers, potentially leading to a greater understanding of these cancers and eventually to improved treatment, control, and prevention.","","","greenlee_occurrence_2010 - The Occurrence of Rare Cancers in U.S. Adults, 1995–2004.pdf",""

The diverse histologies and clinical behaviors of rare pediatric tumors pose challenges to the investigation of their biologic and clinical features. National and international cooperative groups such as the Rare Tumor Committee of the Children's Oncology Group, Rare Tumors in Pediatric Age Project, and European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors have developed several initiatives to advance knowledge about rare pediatric cancers. However, these programs have been only partially effective, necessitating the development of alternative mechanisms to study these challenging diseases. In this article, we review the current national and international collaborative strategies to study rare pediatric cancers and alternative methods under exploration to enhance those efforts, such as independent registries and disease-specific, National Cancer Institute–sponsored clinics.","","","",""

Its distribution suggests that occupational exposures may play a role. In the present study, we searched for occupational factors associated with MF. A European multicenter case-control study on seven rare cancers, including MF, was conducted from 1995 to 1997. Patients between 35 and 69 years of age diagnosed with MF (n = 134) were identified and their diagnoses were checked by a reference pathologist who classified 83 cases as definitive, 35 cases as possible, and 16 cases as not histologically verified Of the 118 histologically verified cases, 104 were interviewed, of which 76 were definitive cases. As controls, we selected population controls and colon cancer controls to serve all seven case groups. Altogether, 833 colon cancer controls and 2071 population controls were interviewed. The response rate was 91.5% for cases (76 of the 83 definitive cases), and 66.6% for controls. A high risk of MF for men was observed in the industries of other non-metallic mineral products (Odds Ratio [OR] 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-16.2) and of wholesale trade (OR 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3-10.5). A high risk was found for female employees in the sector of pulp paper manufacture (OR 14.4, 95% CI = 2.2-95.1). The male occupations with the highest risks were glass formers, potters, and ceramics workers (OR 17.9, 95% CI = 5.4-59.4) and technical salesmen (OR 8.6, 95% CI = 2.4-30.8). For women, the occupations associated with the highest risks were government executives (OR 4.8, 95% CI = 1.0-22.6) and railway and road vehicles loaders (OR 3.9, 95% CI = 1.0-14.0). The results suggest that some occupational factors are associated with MF. Working as glass formers, pottery, and ceramics workers carried the highest risk, and these findings deserve further attention and replication. Females working in the paper and pulp industries may also be exposed to carcinogens of relevance to MF.","","","",""
